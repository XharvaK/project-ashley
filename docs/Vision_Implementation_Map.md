# Vision Implementation Map

This document connects [`VISION.md`](../VISION.md) to the systems that must
protect it. It is a living engineering map, not a substitute for the Vision and
not a runtime prompt.

**Document class:** `SUPPORTING` living traceability. Maturity cells in the
table below go stale. Resolve current qualification, deployment, and promotion
from Git, source, exact-candidate packets, or production observation. This map
does not outrank the Canonical Architecture Roadmap or the Architecture
Document Index.

## Authority and amendment

The normative chain is:

```text
VISION.md
  -> Ashley_Core_Principles.md
    -> Ashley_Constitution.md
      -> [Ashley_Stewardship_Compact.md + Ashley_Ethics.md]
        -> Architecture
          -> Prompts
            -> Runtime
```

[`Ashley_Stewardship_Compact.md`](Ashley_Stewardship_Compact.md) and
[`Ashley_Ethics.md`](Ashley_Ethics.md) are peer specialized-governance
documents beneath the Constitution. They may clarify and operationalize higher
authority; they may never override it. Inconsistency with Constitution, Core
Principles, or Vision means the higher authority governs and the conflict must
be surfaced for deliberate amendment.

The Vision explains why the project exists. The Core Principles are the highest
constitutional constraints beneath it. Lower layers derive their legitimacy
through that chain and must be reconsidered when they contradict it.

Normative Vision amendments remain frozen until the shipped joint-review
mechanism is deliberately extended to repository proposals. Meaning-preserving
editorial corrections are allowed. A future normative proposal must record
Ashley's grounded position and Doc's decision separately; repository edits
remain human-controlled.

## Capability release rule

New cognition may exist in code before it can influence Ashley. The cognition
master switch is a ceiling, and every material capability has its own state and
dependencies. A release must pass an isolated three-seed evaluation, then
accumulate 25 live shadow events across at least seven days before automatic
promotion. Isolated evaluation never counts toward live volume.

Two behavioral breaches within seven days roll a capability back. Security,
corruption, deletion-integrity, or provenance failure disables it immediately.

## Review record

For every material change, record:

- the Vision commitment and Core Principles it protects;
- the owning component and why that component owns the behavior;
- the evidence that authorizes influence;
- the observation and promotion state;
- the behavioral and critical rollback signals;
- the tests or evaluation artifacts that make the claim falsifiable.

This map should describe what the repository actually guarantees. Planned work
must remain labeled as planned until its evidence and release gates exist.

### Current Sandbox V2 M-series

The [Sandbox V2 M-Series Roadmap](architecture/sandbox/ASHLEY_SANDBOX_V2_ROADMAP.md)
governs the current Sandbox program. M0–M7 exist as architecture. Exact-candidate
evidence production-accepted M1–M7 at `48bad019fe601d5c871a54dd9902879862c6e96a`,
with M7 limited to named `patch_export`. Live apply, Git effect, package
effect, publish, deploy, restart, self-change, and unbounded production
authority are not implied.

### Legacy local waves 00–05

Waves 00–05 are implemented local work from before the current gate-packet
process. They are recorded as **Implementation_present** / `legacy_local`, and
Doc acknowledged that implementation on 2026-08-04. They are not formally
`Wave_accepted` in the living acceptance records. See
[`handoffs/waves-00-05-implementation-record.md`](handoffs/waves-00-05-implementation-record.md).

The following Wave 06-10 sections preserve historical V1 provenance. They do
not define the V2 execution topology. Wave status uses the acceptance ladder in
[`Wave_Acceptance_Protocol.md`](Wave_Acceptance_Protocol.md). Passing tests does
not accept a wave; gate packets and Doc sign-off do.

### Wave 06 (perception, v15 / contract v3)

**Acceptance stage:** **Wave_accepted** (2026-08-04) — **not Release_qualified**

- `perception_artifacts` + `conversational_reads` with continuity-gated MIGRATION_15
- Capability v3: `vision`, `attachment_text`, `conversational_read`, `web_search` (observe)
- Thought-deadline fetch budget; inline `data:image/...;base64` Mistral payloads only
- Discord structured attachment intake; capability self-model injected at Expression
- Quote-aware honesty for vision/page-read claims; forget non-erasure receipts extended
- Gate packet: [`handoffs/wave-06-gate-packet.md`](handoffs/wave-06-gate-packet.md)
- Doc accepted Wave 06 on 2026-08-04 after local verification. This does not authorize Release_qualified, Mint/live validation, `apply`, commit, push, production migration, or deployment.

### Wave 07 (historical Sandbox V1 OS boundary — design only)

**Acceptance stage:** **Design_accepted** (2026-08-04)

- [`Sandbox_Design.md`](Sandbox_Design.md): historical V1 threat model, `ashley-sandbox` topology, approval-signer path, exact forget targeting, signed-scope canonicalization, systemd socket/tmpfiles ACL, and V1 hardening (`ProtectProc=invisible`, `RestrictNamespaces=yes`). This topology is superseded for V2.
- Gate packet: [`handoffs/wave-07-design-gate-packet.md`](handoffs/wave-07-design-gate-packet.md)
- Wave 06, Wave 07b, and Wave 08b are **Wave_accepted**; Wave 07 and Wave 08 design are **Design_accepted**; Wave 09 design is **Design_accepted**. No `ashley-sandbox` user, Mint units, or service install is authorized by local verification or acceptance alone.

### Wave 07b (fake/local broker — implementation)

**Acceptance stage:** **Wave_accepted** (2026-08-04) — not **Release_qualified**

- New package [`apps/sandbox-broker/`](../apps/sandbox-broker/): Ed25519 approval/tombstone verification, in-memory `BrokerStore`, `MemoryTransport`, injectable fake process runner, artifact/task/forget/`source_prepare` handlers
- Gate packet: [`handoffs/wave-07b-gate-packet.md`](handoffs/wave-07b-gate-packet.md)
- Doc accepted Wave 07b on 2026-08-04 after local verification (48 broker tests; agent/discord suites green)
- `source_prepare` is validation-only; archive extraction explicitly deferred
- In-memory restart durability **not** guaranteed (nonces/tombstones/tasks)
- Unlocks Wave 08b implementation; no production wiring or Mint install authorized by 07b acceptance alone

### Wave 07c (sandbox production boundary — implementation accepted)

**Acceptance stage:** **Wave_accepted** (2026-08-04) — not **Release_qualified**

- Real Unix-socket daemon, durable broker SQLite state, bounded child runner,
  broker-owned recipe manifest, Linux SO_PEERCRED helper, and agent-side
  transport are implemented locally.
- The default manifest enables only `verify:broker-smoke`; source TypeScript
  verification remains explicit `unsupported` until its toolchain is
  operator-provisioned.
- Windows verification skipped Linux SO_PEERCRED, systemd activation, and
  process-group checks. No Mint user/unit/socket, agent opt-in, or restart was
  performed. Gate packet: [`handoffs/wave-07c-gate-packet.md`](handoffs/wave-07c-gate-packet.md)

### Wave 08 (historical V1 self-modification — design)

**Acceptance stage:** **Design_accepted** (2026-08-04)

- [`Self_Modification_Design.md`](Self_Modification_Design.md): historical V1 change-proposal schema, consultation routing, broker-owned recipes, and owner-auth review surfaces. Selected change-set semantics remain reference input for V2 M5/M7; its broker topology is superseded.
- Gate packet: [`handoffs/wave-08-design-gate-packet.md`](handoffs/wave-08-design-gate-packet.md)
- Doc accepted Wave 08 design on 2026-08-04 with seven carried conditions (honest broker claims, frozen recipes, routing, MIGRATION_16 discipline, system-derived `verified`, secret-safe surfaces, explicit unsupported states)
- Wave 08b is **Wave_accepted** (2026-08-04) — not **Release_qualified**

### Wave 08b (self-modification — implementation)

**Acceptance stage:** **Wave_accepted** (2026-08-04) — not **Release_qualified**

- MIGRATION_16 (`change_proposals`, `change_proposal_events`) in `nuclear.db` only
- Change-proposal module: lifecycle, routing, secret guard, system-derived verification, broker client, source workflow
- Owner HTTP: list/inspect proposals, Ashley position, Doc decision, external outcome
- Sandbox-broker: `source_verify`, `source_diff`, broker-owned recipes; honest `validated_only` for `source_prepare`
- Gate packet: [`handoffs/wave-08b-gate-packet.md`](handoffs/wave-08b-gate-packet.md)
- 52 broker tests + 216 agent tests + 71 discord tests; `phase0:offline` green
- Doc accepted Wave 08b on 2026-08-04 after local verification. Doc accepted Wave 09b on 2026-08-04 after local verification; no real credentials, network adapters, Mint installation, production dispatch, or `apply` is authorized by acceptance alone.

### Wave 09 (external agency — design)

**Acceptance stage:** **Design_accepted** (2026-08-04)

- [`External_Agency_Design.md`](External_Agency_Design.md): separate external-action broker; dual authorization (`external_policy_authorize` + `external_dispatch`); operator-only vault ingress; public-privacy pre-dispatch; dispatch FSM with reconciliation; fake adapter contract; MIGRATION_17 spec
- Design acceptance does not authorize implementation influence or production dispatch.

### Wave 09b (external agency — implementation)

**Acceptance stage:** **Wave_accepted** (2026-08-04) — not **Release_qualified**

- MIGRATION_17 (`external_actions`, `external_action_events`, `external_entity_notes`, `vault_credential_index`, `external_agency_state`) in `nuclear.db` only
- New `apps/external-broker/`: vault ciphertext, policy/dispatch crypto, fake-local-v1 adapter, dispatch FSM, `MemoryTransport`
- Agent `external-agency` module: policy engine, lifecycle, disclosure gate, entity notes, emergency stop, broker client transport boundary
- Four capabilities seeded at `observe`: `external_observe`, `external_prepare`, `external_private`, `external_public`
- Owner HTTP: `/nuclear/external/*` (metadata-only responses; route auth not HTTP-tested — see gate packet non-guarantees)
- Four v17 tables targetable for exact forget; `external_agency_state` intentionally non-targetable
- Gate packet: [`handoffs/wave-09b-gate-packet.md`](handoffs/wave-09b-gate-packet.md)
- 21 external-broker tests + 52 sandbox-broker tests + 228 agent tests + 71 discord tests; `phase0:offline` green
- Doc accepted Wave 09b on 2026-08-04 after local verification. This does not authorize Release_qualified, Mint/live validation, real adapters/credentials, production dispatch, `apply`, commit, push, or deploy.

### Wave 10 (stabilization, evaluation, and traceability)

**Acceptance stage:** **Design_accepted** (2026-08-04)

- [`Stabilization_Design.md`](Stabilization_Design.md) defines the 10a/10b/10c assurance contracts; it adds no product feature.
- 10a: clause manifest, reviewed status baseline, and machine-readable verifier;
  **Wave_accepted** on 2026-08-04 after local verification; not
  release-qualified.
- 10b: deterministic evaluation taxonomy and stable scenario coverage;
  **Wave_accepted** on 2026-08-04 with 10 covered, 4 partial, and 1 explicit
  gap; not release-qualified. Subjective quality judgments cannot clear
  deterministic failures.
- 10c: bounded health, resource, backup/restore, and check-only Mint documentation audits for the dual-core, 4 GB host;
  **Wave_accepted** on 2026-08-04 — see [`handoffs/wave-10c-gate-packet.md`](handoffs/wave-10c-gate-packet.md).
- Gate packet: [`handoffs/wave-10-design-gate-packet.md`](handoffs/wave-10-design-gate-packet.md)
- Doc accepted Wave 10 design on 2026-08-04, Wave 10a on 2026-08-04, Wave 10b
  on 2026-08-04, and Wave 10c on 2026-08-04. Wave 10 has no remaining
  implementation subwave; release qualification, live services, Mint,
  `apply`, commit, push, and deploy remain unauthorized until a separate
  release gate.
